# Calendar

## What

Implement an HTML5 1-dimensional (i.e., 1-week) calendar that displays a car’s availability. At a minimum:

- the user should be able to page among the weeks
- page zero should be this week; the last page should be three months from now
- the calendar should indicate dates that are not available (data below)
- unavailable dates should be visually distinct from dates in the past

```js
var unavailableDates = [
  "2015-06-01",
  "2015-06-08",
  "2015-06-15",
  "2015-06-16",
  "2015-06-17",
  "2015-07-03",
  "2015-07-04",
  "2015-07-05",
  "2015-07-12",
  "2015-07-29"
];
```

You can structure your code and dependencies however you like, but the minimum completed project is a .zip  with an `index.html` that runs in a local browser.

## Why

A key aspect of matching renters and owners is vehicle availability—an owner needs to be able to manage and view their vehicle’s availability. We strive to display availability in a user-friendly, information-dense manner.

## A little more

Feel free to use open-source frameworks, such as jQuery, Angular, or React. Please do not simply use a calendar plug-in or component for these frameworks, such as [jQuery UI Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/).
